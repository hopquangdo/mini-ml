## 🚀 What is MiniMLModels?

**MiniMLModels** is a personal project that reimplements popular machine learning and deep learning models from the ground up — no scikit-learn, no PyTorch, just pure math and logic.  
It's built to help you truly understand how models work under the hood by dissecting and coding them line by line.
